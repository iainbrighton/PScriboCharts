SYNOPSIS
    PScribo Charts is a charting library for Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core.

DESCRIPTION
    PScribo Charts is an open source project that provides a PowerShell facade over the
    [System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting] .NET library. PScribo Charts provides a set of functions for
    authoring charts and graphs in Windows PowerShell for use in documentation and/or web pages, e.g. with
    PScribo - http://github.com/iainbrighton/PScribo

    Due to its reliance on the [System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization.Charting] .NET library, this module only
    works on Microsoft Windows devices. However, Windows PowerShell and PowerShell (Core) are supported.

    Requires __Powershell 3.0__ or later.

OTHER EXAMPLES
    Included in the PScribo Charts module are some documented example scripts in the .\Examples directory.
